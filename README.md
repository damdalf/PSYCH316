---
There's not much to put here, this is just a Git repository that will serve as the location of my notes for the duration of this class. Cognitive psychology is a branch of psychology which studies mental processes such as attention, language use, memory, perception, problem-solving, creativity and reasoning. Cognitive psychology originated in the 1960's as a branching off of Behaviorism.
